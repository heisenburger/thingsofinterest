subtitle: "How do we ensure our privacy in an increasingly digitised world? How does trust work in this space and how is it different from what we understand? What is informed consent when we cannot be informed, when it is impossible to be informed? And if we cannot consent, who should manage that consent? Governments? Corporations? Neither or both? And what does this mean for our genetic information?"
