subtitle: "Today's episode is a bit of a two-for-one: listen to the first part to learn about the ins and outs of how to send secret messages (and how your information is privately stored online!). Here's the thing that you probably can't hear in the audio though: there was a heat wave when we were recording, and it got so hot we could barely think. And cryptography is a subject that requires a lot of thinking! So, listen to the second part (starting at 29:29) to hear us lament about global warming, and the things we can do to alleviate and hopefully avoid the worst possible future. Throw in a classic Sophia rant™ about mental health, and you've got yourself a classic Things of Interest episode! Enjoy."
