subtitle: "This episode we talk race, culture and identity in New Zealand with the wonderful Marcelle Wharerau. Did our teachers in high school communicate the importance of NZ history enough? What cultural aspects did colonialism imprint on Maori and what did it erase? How does it affect other non-European New Zealanders, even now? And what is Pakeha culture?"
