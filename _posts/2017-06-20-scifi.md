subtitle: "Probably our nerdiest episode to date. Battlestar Galactica, Mass Effect, Star Trek, Animorphs, with the usual distractions and foray into race, gender and identity, and how that manifests differently in different cultures. Also: Mars Trilogy, The Three Body Problem, Orphan Black, Steven Universe, mild Joss Whedon, Gattaca, Gravity, Arrival, good/bad storytelling, and the distribution of the future."
