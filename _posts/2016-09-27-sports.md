subtitle: "It's the Olympics! The wonderful event where athletes show off their incredible achievements and sports journalists show off their sexism. Does it make sense to gender-segregate sports in 2016? Just how bad is the wage gap in sports? Also: the Paralympics. They are badass and don't get nearly enough attention."

summary: "It's the Olympics! The wonderful event where athletes show off their incredible achievements and sports journalists show off their sexism. Does it make sense to gender-segregate sports in 2016? Just how bad is the wage gap in sports? Also: the Paralympics. They are badass and don't get nearly enough attention."

shownotes: |
  An episode in which we attempt to not miss public interest in the Olympics and dramatically fail, Serena uses her physics degree to use a calculator, and Sophia attempts to pronounce a lot of names. Also, at the end there, we get mad and sad about racism, and excited for the Paralympics, which were now like a month ago. Great job all around.
