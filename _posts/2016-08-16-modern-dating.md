subtitle: "Relationships can look many different ways, it’s increasingly legal to not be straight, and basically nobody says the word “spinster” anymore. How great is that? Also: Tinder, Bumble, and the unexpected downsides to our communication technologies."

summary: "Episode six: Where we talk about dating, relationships, and the internet, and Sophia’s life as a long-term single lady can finally be useful rather than a source of angst. Relationships can look many different ways, it’s increasingly legal to not be straight, and basically nobody says the word “spinster” anymore. How great is that?"

We also somehow manage to not mention the Bachelor/ette? Clearly this means we should have a followup episode. (Serena's shaking her head.)

Sophia finished reading this like a week before we recorded this episode so some of what she says will reference things she learned from the book, and it almost definitely influenced the words she said.
