subtitle: "Emotional labour is important, invisible work that we all do - and it's great! It strengthens relationships and makes us better people. The problems arise when there is an imbalance, when a member of a relationship is left to do the majority of the labour, while the other reaps the benefits. Today we discuss this labour: what it is, how historically women are expected to perform the vast majority of it, and how it interplays with our relationships. We make our usual diversions into work, unions, pay equity, and discuss how to be better reciprocators of emotional labour ourselves."
