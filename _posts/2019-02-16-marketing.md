subtitle: "Today we grapple with multinational corporations endorsing social justice messages as a part of their marketing. How does this empower rising social movements? How does this dilute their civil rights messages? And how might we approach this with the right balance of support and skepticism? We then chat about the gamer identity, and how that niche has become a hotbed for hate. And how we can offer different aesthetics for gaming culture that's pastel and soft and nice."
