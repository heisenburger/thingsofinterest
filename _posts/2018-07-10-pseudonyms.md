subtitle: "What is in a name? Today we talk pseudonyms, identity, and personal perception. Is your name a branding tool, something to be co-opted then discarded when necessary? Is it a family treasure, something imbued with history, ancestry, and deep spiritual meaning? Is it a commodity used to strengthen unpopular opinions, or an anchor that ties us to remaining decent human beings? When is it these things, and how do we reconcile the paradoxical nature of the names, handles, and pseudonyms we use throughout life?"
