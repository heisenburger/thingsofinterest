subtitle: "Welcome to the wonderful world of film. Today we have the talented and insightful Cassandra Tse joining us as we discuss the power of films, what they mean to us and how it interacts with the people in society. We touch on the political power of movies (for both conservative and progressive messaging), representation, modern myths, #MeToo, film as a training tool for empathy, the emotional impact of stories, how women are represented on screen, awards, and how everything interplays with the public consciousness."
