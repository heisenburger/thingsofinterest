subtitle: "How has technology changed what it means to be human? How we view our identities? How have machine learning algorithms conditioned our brains and who is to blame? How do we make technological leaps without doing harm? How does technology affect how we talk about ethics and morality? We also chat about the cultural and linguistic changes that comes with technology: our increased awareness of mental health issues, our ability to communicate through memes. And finally, how we can spend time with friends irl when everyone is extrememly on the internet."
