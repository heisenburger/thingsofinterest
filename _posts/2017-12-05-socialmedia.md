subtitle: "How is social media making us all less sociable? Today we talk about social networks, the morally ambiguous things they do, how it served as a manipulation tool during elections, how the economic model of the Internet (advertising) incentivises companies to put up with bad actors, abusive users, and sometimes even lead them to act immorally by themselves. We also touch on the horrific situation on Manus Island, and the #MeToo movement of women coming out against their sexual harrassers and abusers. And of course, how post-capitalism continues to be a nightmare. It's a fun episode!"
