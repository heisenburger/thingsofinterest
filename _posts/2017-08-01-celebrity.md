subtitle: "What is a reasonable amount of responsibility to expect from high-visibility individuals? Why are some celebrities so vehemently defended when they've done something wrong, while others shamed for the public's enjoyment? How do we navigate a world that is increasingly intrusive and less authentic? Plus, we gush over our shared love of Suzy Cato. Content warning for chats around suicide and how people respond to it from 28:36 to 35:14."
