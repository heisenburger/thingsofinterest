summary: "You want to call out a bad joke, but you don't want to be *that person*. How do we talk about social topics without putting people on the defensive?"

shownotes: |
  Episode five: when we describe why we don’t have friends. Joking! We have heaps of friends, and we also know how to call said friends out when they’re being a bit terrible. Learn from our wisdom - and contribute some of yours if you want! We’re on twitter [@castinginterest](http://twitter.com/castinginterest), remember.

  The show notes for this episode are shorter because our conversations were based more in our own experiences. It should be noted that both of us were predominantly raised and live in a Western liberal democracy (that isn’t the US), so our experiences are through that lens.
