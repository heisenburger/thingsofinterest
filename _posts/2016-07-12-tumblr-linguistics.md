summary: "Do your friends berade you for using too many emoji, not making correct sentences, and using memes as replies too often? We look into the strange world of Tumblr linguistics, and how young girls are shaping the next era of language."

shownotes: |
  Episode three: the episode where it becomes incredibly clear that we’re both meming tumblr trash, and where Sophia refuses to do the Home Improvement Confused Grunt Noise (and earns that explicit tag). Text-based media are opening a new window into cultural and linguistic development and we have a good time discussing this, and swapping some dank memes.

  This article covers the thoroughly confusing amount of ‘dank memes’ in the Australian election campaign. For clarification: nobody in Australia understood what was going on, either.

  [Homestuck](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/)

  A warning: Homestuck is long. In June 2012, it was described as ‘[a little under one bible](https://web.archive.org/web/20160315221440/http://www.mspaforums.com/showthread.php?48889-Measuring-Homestuck-%28Data%21-Charts%21-Graphs%21%29)’ in adjusted length, and it’s got a lot longer since then. But it is a seminal piece of internet literature and has had a notable effect in culture - we can talk about that more in the fandom episode.


  ## Books:
  Richard Dawkins, “The Selfish Gene” (1976)
  Though sometimes (all the time) I wish dick dorkins would stay in his lane, this was actually not a bad book.
