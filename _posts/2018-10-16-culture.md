subtitle: "This is a very personal episode for both of us. Today we talk about our own histories — childhood memories, experiences, and how the communities around which we grew up have shaped our own culture. We talk about how we relate to our parents, our families. How Sophia's time growing up in Lebanon shaped her view of the world and how she reacted to events like 9/11. How Serena's journey back to China wasn't quite what she had hoped for. But most of all, we find that these concepts of culture, community and home are things that we can build for ourselves. In this episode, we're a little more vulnerable than usual. We enjoyed it, and we hope you do too."
