subtitle: "We react to the events of Charlottesville, the danger of white moderates and neo-nazi sympathisers, free speech, the importance of continually interrogating your own beliefs. On the topic of things that infuriate us, we touch on the Google screed. From 32:53 we officially run out of emotional energy and do a 180 and ask each other about the positive things that have happened in our lives lately. We hope this podcast finds you smiling, despite the current state of the world. Take care of yourselves. Peace <3"
