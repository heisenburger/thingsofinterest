subtitle: "I can only describe this episode as catharsis. We start with a mini-therapy session as we discuss our feelings and the different ways we manage them. Then, as we feel stronger and more capable, we move on to discussing the real change that we can influence to make the world a better place for everyone. This episode uplifted me and placated my worst anxieties. I hope you enjoy it too."
