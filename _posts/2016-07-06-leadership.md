Here is the list of articles we (claim to have) read and media we discussed during this episode. You never know how terrible you sound saying #topical until you hear yourself recorded saying #topical.

All articles were last accessed on 29/5/16 unless otherwise stated. If you have been upset by anything in this episode, get in touch with family or friends, or [your local hotline](http://togetherweare-strong.tumblr.com/helpline).

## Articles we (may have) read before this episode:

- “[French former ministers launch attack on sexism in politics](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/15/french-former-ministers-launch-attack-on-sexism-in-politics).” Kim Willsher (15/5/16), The Guardian.
- “[‘We can no longer stay silent’: fury erupts over sexism in French politics](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/we-can-no-longer-stay-silent-fury-erupts-over-sexism-in-french-politics).” Angelique Chrisafis (14/5/16), The Guardian.
- “[Bernie Sanders isn’t a woman, but is he a better feminist than Hillary Clinton?](https://theconversation.com/bernie-sanders-isnt-a-woman-but-is-he-a-better-feminist-than-hillary-clinton-54624)” Cynthia Weber (13/2/16), The Conversation
- Grunspan, Daniel, et al. “[Males Under-Estimate Academic Performance of Their Female Peers in Undergraduate Biology Classrooms](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148405).” PLOS ONE, 2016; 11 (2)
- “[IBM pulls #HackAHairDryer campaign admitting it 'missed the mark'](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/07/ibm-sparks-anger-with-hackahairdryer-campaign-aimed-at-women)” Elena Cresci (8/12/15), The Guardian.
- “[The Motherhood Penalty vs. the Fatherhood Bonus](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/a-child-helps-your-career-if-youre-a-man.html?_r=0)” Claire Miller (6/9/14), The New York Times.
- “[Why the Empathetic Leader Is the Best Leader](http://www.success.com/article/why-the-empathetic-leader-is-the-best-leader)” Toby Noton (21/8/14), Success.com
- Stulp, Gert, et al. "[Tall claims? Sense and nonsense about the importance of height of US presidents](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984312000884)." The Leadership Quarterly 24.1 (2013): 159-171.

Note that our comment about height of presidential candidates appears to be inaccurate - there is no statistically significant link between being the taller candidate and winning the actual election. Taller presidents were more likely to win re-election, and presidential candidates overall were taller than their birth cohort.

- “[PM's youthful look attacked.](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10532504)” Eloise Gibbon (17/9/2008), NZ Herald.

This one was chosen over other… ah… less kind articles. You can search for those yourself, if you’re curious.

- “[The Set-Up to Fail Syndrome](https://hbr.org/1998/03/the-set-up-to-fail-syndrome)” Jean-François Manzoni and Jean-Louis Barsoux (1998), Harvard Business Review.

We did not read these articles before the episode was recorded but we’ve read them since and we like them:

- “[Why I’m Supporting Clinton, and I hope the San Francisco Bay Area Does Too](https://medium.com/@kurafire/why-im-supporting-clinton-and-hope-the-san-francisco-bay-area-does-too-a423e246442d#.ywpo4qwh0)” Faruk Ates (7/6/16), Medium.com

## Things (possibly of interest) we recommend:

- Niccolo Machiavelli, “The Prince” (1532)
- [Confidence Tote Bag](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/254893785/confidence-tote-bag).
- [I’m not bossy. I’m the boss.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dynbzMlCcw)

The “Ban Bossy” campaign isn’t something we know a lot about and so we can’t say whether we wholeheartedly support it. But we like this video.
