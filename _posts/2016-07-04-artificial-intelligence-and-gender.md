As two self-identified nerds, we had a great time talking about the development of technology and artificial intelligence. And since you're probably a fellow nerd, we guessed you'd be pining for links to expand your mental horizons; hence we've listed all the relevant articles and media that we've read/watched/mentioned. 

We ought to note that we don’t necessarily agree with everything the articles say, and both of us didn’t necessarily read all of them, but they all made it into our brain-pan somehow. Alright, here we go !
