subtitle: "We had such a great conversation we had to separate this episode to three parts! In part one we talk about curating ethical habits, the gig economy, and the value of work. We then pivot a to the minimum wage, welfare, universal basic income, and the like. Lastly, calling out vs calling in. Excuse us as we dabble in discussion around the economy - we're not trained economists so please do email in if we've told any lies."
