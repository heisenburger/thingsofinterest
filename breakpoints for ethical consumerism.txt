Hey beautiful listeners! This is Things of Interest, and you're listening to part 2 of our conversation on ethical consumerism.

Hey listeners! This is Things of Interest, and you've made it to part 3 of our conversation on ethical consumption. In part 2 we talked about science: is it a public good? How do we fund it? How do we incentivise good science and avoid fraud? This time we're getting back on the economics train to talk about capitalism, libertarianism, and the murking world of morality and ethics. I really enjoyed this conversation, and I hope you do too. Here's part 3.
