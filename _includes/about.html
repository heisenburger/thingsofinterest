      <p>Things of Interest is a podcast that encompasses, in its purest form, things that we find interesting. Our discussions often center around technological advancements and how they affect social issues. As two socially-conscious millennial nerds, who better placed to talk about artificial intelligence, leadership, bitcoin, modern dating, gene editing, and fandom? Probably no-one.</p>
      <p>Weâ€™re both from New Zealand so have beautiful accents that you can put in your ears. Episodes are roughly an hour long, and come out when they come out.</p>
      <p>Things of Interest is a non-commercial podcast. We run no ads, make no money and are beholden to nobody. ðŸ¤˜</p>
