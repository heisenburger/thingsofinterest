> Two nerds, having great chats.

Things of Interest is hosted by Serena Chen and Sophia Frentz, and is a podcast that encompasses, in its purest form, things that we find interesting. Our discussions often center around technological advancements and how they affect social issues. As two socially-conscious millennial nerds, who is better placed to talk about artificial intelligence, leadership, modern dating, the job market, and fandom? Probably no-one.

We’re also both from New Zealand so have beautiful accents that you can put in your ears. Episodes are roughly a half hour long, and come out every two weeks.

> Non-feminist topics, through a feminist lens.

Sophia currently lives in Melbourne, where she is undertaking a PhD in clinical genetics, but has never been able to focus on one thing at a time, so does a lot of non-PhD things. She’s a published poet and writer and chronically ill, queer, and addicted to coffee. You can find her on twitter at @SophiaFrentz.

Serena currently lives in Wellington, where she's creating design systems at [BNZ Digital](https://www.bnz.co.nz). She has two degrees in physics, dabbles in everything from hacking to making things pretty, and has lived in Berkeley for a year which makes her officially cultured. You can find her on twitter at @Sereeena.

> We are doers of things.

As two classically easily-distracted sneeple (snake people), we run a lot of projects on the side. Here's a list of some other stuff we do, just in case you're interested.

Or do. Actually, we'd love to hear from you. Send in your questions, episode suggestions, and general thoughts to [@castinginterest](http://twitter.com/castinginterest)

Or even better: record a voice memo of your question/thought/suggestion/observation/etc and email it through to us at castinginterest@gmail.com. We might host it on our show if you're cool enough (trust me, you will be).
