> Non-feminist topics, through a feminist lens.

Things of Interest is hosted by Serena Chen and Sophia Frentz, and is a podcast that encompasses, in its purest form, things that we find interesting. Our discussions often center around technological advancements and how they affect social issues. As two socially-conscious millennial nerds, who better placed to talk about artificial intelligence, leadership, modern dating, the job market, and fandom? Probably no-one.

We’re also both from New Zealand so have beautiful accents that you can put in your ears. Episodes are roughly a half hour long, and come out every two weeks.

> Two nerds, having great chats.

Sophia currently lives in Melbourne, where she is undertaking a PhD in clinical genetics, but has never been able to focus on one thing at a time, so does a lot of non-PhD things. She’s a published poet and writer and chronically ill, queer, and addicted to coffee. You can find her on twitter at [@SophiaFrentz](http://twitter.com/SophiaFrentz).

Serena currently lives in Wellington, where she's creating design systems at [BNZ Digital](https://www.bnz.co.nz). She has two degrees in physics, dabbles in everything from hacking to making things pretty, and has lived in Berkeley for a year which makes her officially cultured. She made this website. You can find her on twitter at [@Sereeena](http://twitter.com/Sereeena).

> Side ~~baes~~ projects.

As two classically easily-distracted sneeple (snake people), we run a lot of projects on the side. Here's a list of some other stuff we do, and where else you can find us, just in case you're interested.

Cool.

> Don't @ me bro.

Or do. Actually, we'd love to hear from you. Send in your questions, episode suggestions, and general thoughts to [@castinginterest](http://twitter.com/castinginterest)

Even better: record a voice memo of your question / thought / suggestion / observation / etc and email it through to us at [castinginterest@gmail.com](mailto:castinginterest@gmail.com). We might even feature it on our show. Winky face.

Found a bug on this website? Tell Serena to fix it by logging an issue on the [Git repo](https://github.com/heisenburger/thingsofinterest/issues), and she will promise to only procrastinate for two days at most.
