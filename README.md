# Things of Interest

Things of Interest is hosted by Serena Chen and Sophia Frentz, and is a podcast that encompasses, in its purest form, things that we find interesting. Our discussions often center around technological advancements and how they affect social issues. As two socially-conscious millennial nerds, who better placed to talk about artificial intelligence, leadership, modern dating, the job market, and fandom? Probably no-one.

Weâ€™re also both from New Zealand so have beautiful accents that you can put in your ears. Episodes are roughly a half hour long, and come out every two weeks.
